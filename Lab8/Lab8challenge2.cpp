/*
  Your Name Here: 

  Write a program that reads the numbers from the file numbers.txt.
  Then sort the numbers in ascending order (for example: 0 1 2 3 4 5 ..)
  Print the smallest, median, and largest numbers.

  Sample run with a file that has the numbers 0 to 49:
    Smallest: 0
    Median: 24.5
    Largest: 49

  Hints:
  - you can reuse your code from challenge 1.
  - the smallest number will be at index 0
  - the largest number will be at index 49
  - the median is the middle value, on even sets it's the mean of the middle 2 values
  - therefore the median will be the average of the numbers at index 24 and 25
