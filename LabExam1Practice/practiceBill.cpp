  YOUR NAME HERE: 

  1. Write a program that prompts the user for their quarterly water bill for the last 4 quarters.
     The program should then calculate and display the average monthly water bill.

     If the average monthly water bill is greater than $75, the program should display a message indicating that the water bill is too high.
     If the average monthly water bill is less than $25, the program should display a message praising the user for their low water bill.
      Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating that the water bill is reasonable.

  Example Runs:

      Please input your water bill for the first quarter
