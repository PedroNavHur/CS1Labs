/* Exercises

  YOUR NAME HERE:

  1. Fill in the code so that the program will do the following:
     - Write your first and last name on one line
     - Write your address on the next line
     - Write your city, state and zip code on the last line
     - Write your phone number on the last line

     Example:
      John Doe
      123 Main Street
      Anytown, CA 12345
      555-555-5555

      Hints:
      - You will need to use the cout object to write out the strings
      - You will need to use the << operator to write out the strings
      - You will need to use the endl manipulator to end the line

   2. Let's format your output. Change the program so that it's printed
      like this:

      Programmer: John Doe
                  123 Main Street
                  Anytown, CA 12345
                  555-555-5555

      Phone Number: 555-555-5555

      Hints:
      - You could do it by using multiple cout statements and endl manipulators
      - In the future you'll learn how to use the setw() manipulator to format
        your output more easily.
