    Exercises:

    1. Write a program that will read in grades, the number of which is also input by the user.
       The program will find the sum of those grades and then calculate the average.
       The program will then output the letter grade of that average on a 10-point scale.

       90-100: A
        80-89: B
        70-79: C
        60-69: D
        0-59: F


    Sample Run:

    How many grades will you input? 5
    Enter grade 1: 90
    Enter grade 2: 85
    Enter grade 3: 75
    Enter grade 4: 60
    Enter grade 5: 50
    The sum of the grades is: 360
    The average of the grades is: 72
    The letter grade is: C

    Hints:
       *You must use functions to complete this program.
       *You must use a loop to input the grades.
