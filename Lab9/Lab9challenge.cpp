/*
  Your Name:

  Write a program that will read monthly sales from a sales.txt file
  into a dynamically allocated array.

  The first line of the file will contain the number of sales to read.
  The rest of the file will contain the sales.

  Sort the sales using your choice of sorting algorithm.

  Your program will then output the sales in ascending order.
  Your program will output the lowest, highest, and average sales.

  Example sales.txt file:
    5
    100
    300
    500
    200
    500

  Example output:
    Sales in ascending order:
      100
      200
      300
      500
      500
    Lowest: 100
    Highest: 500githu
    Average: 320

  Note: You are required to use a dynamically allocated array.
        That is, you must use the new operator to allocate memory for the array.
        You must also use the delete operator to deallocate memory for the array.
        You can use sorting algorithms from previous labs or from the <algorithm> library.

  But again: You must use a dynamically allocated array. Aka, no vectors.
