  YOUR NAME HERE: 

  1. Write a program that uses a structure to store the following information for a particular month
     at the local airport:

      Total number of planes that landed
      Total number of planes that took off
      Greatest number of planes that landed in a single day
      Greatest number of planes that took off in a single day

    The program should have an array or vector of 12 structures to hold this information.
    The program should prompt the user to enter the data for each month.
    The program should then output the total number of planes that landed and took off for the year.
    The program should also output the month with the greatest number of planes that landed and took off.

    Example Runs:
    Please enter the data for total landed, total took off, greatest landed, greatest took off for each month:
    Month 1: 100 100 100 100
    Month 2: 200 200 200 200
    Month 3: 300 300 300 300
    Month 4: 400 400 400 400
    Month 5: 500 500 500 500
    Month 6: 600 600 600 600
    Month 7: 700 700 700 700
    Month 8: 800 800 800 800
    Month 9: 900 900 900 900
    Month 10: 1000 1000 1000 1000
    Month 11: 1100 1100 1100 1100
    Month 12: 1200 1200 1200 1200

    Total planes landed: 7800
    Total planes took off: 7800
    Month with greatest planes landed: 12
    Month with greatest planes took off: 12
