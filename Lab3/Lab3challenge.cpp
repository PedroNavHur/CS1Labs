  YOUR NAME HERE: 

    1. Write a program from scratch that calculates the total sales tax on a purchase.
       The program should ask the user to input the total sales for the month, the state sales tax rate, and the local sales tax rate.
       The program should then calculate and display the total sales taxes.
       
       Example:
         Please input the total sales for the month
         > 1000
         Please input the state sales tax rate in decimal form
         > 0.05
         Please input the local sales tax rate in decimal form
         > 0.03
         The total sales is $1000.00
         The state sales tax is $50.00
         The local sales tax is $30.00
         The total sales tax is $80.00

        Hints: state sales tax = total sales * state sales tax rate
               local sales tax = total sales * local sales tax rate
               total sales tax = state sales tax + local sales tax
