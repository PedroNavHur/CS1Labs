  // YOUR NAME HERE

  Write a program that reads a survey tally on beverages from a file and then prints
  the results to another file.

  Each person participating in the survey could choose from the following beverages:
    1. Coffee
    2. Tea
    3. Coke
    4. Orange Juice

  The file has a list of numbers where each number represents the beverage chosen by a person.
  And a -1 at the end of the list to indicate the end of the survey.
  
  For example, if the input file has the following numbers:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    1
    2
    1
    3
    -1
  
  The output file should have the following:
    The survey results are:
    Coffee: 3
    Tea: 2
    Coke: 2
    Orange Juice: 1


  Hints:
  - You'll need to read the input file and count the number of times each beverage is chosen.
  - You'll need to print the results to the output file.
