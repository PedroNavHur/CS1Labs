  YOUR NAME HERE: 

  1. Write a program that calculates the tuition and fees for a student at UCA.

     UCA charges $9000 per semester for in-state tuition and $15000 per semester for out-of-state tuition.
     UCA charges $3000 for living on campus, it doesn't matter if you are in-state or out-of-state.

      The program should ask the user to input their residency status (in-state or out-of-state)
      and wheter they will live on campus or not.
      The program should then calculate and display the total tuition and fees.

  Example Runs:

      Please input your residency status (in-state or out-of-state)
      > in-state
      Will you live on campus? (yes or no)
      > no
      The total tuition and fees is $9000.00

      Please input your residency status (in-state or out-of-state)
      > in-state
      Will you live on campus? (yes or no)
      > yes
      The total tuition and fees is $12000.00

      Please input your residency status (in-state or out-of-state)
      > out-of-state
      Will you live on campus? (yes or no)
      > no
      The total tuition and fees is $15000.00

      Please input your residency status (in-state or out-of-state)
      > in-state
      Will you live on campus? (yes or no)
      > yes
      The total tuition and fees is $18000.00

     Hints: in-state tuition = $9000
            out-of-state tuition = $15000
            living on campus = $3000
            total tuition and fees = tuition + living on campus
