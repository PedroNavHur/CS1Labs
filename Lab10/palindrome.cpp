// Student Generated Exercise 1

/* Exercise

  A palindrome is a string of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
  For example, "madam" is a palindrome.

  Write a program that uses a function to determine if a string is a palindrome.
  A message should be displayed indicating whether or not the string is a palindrome.

  Hint: use the strlen() function to determine the length of the string.
        use a loop to compare the first character to the last character, the second character to the second to last character, etc.
        if the characters are the same, continue the loop.
        if the characters are different, the string is not a palindrome.
