// Student Generated Exercise 2

/* Exercise

  Write a program that reads two names (name1, name2)
  And then prints them in alphabetical order.
  If the names are the same, print a message indicating that the names are the same.
  
  Hint: use the strcmp() function to compare the names.
        strcmp() returns 0 if the strings are the same.
        strcmp() returns a negative number if the first string is less than the second string.
        strcmp() returns a positive number if the first string is greater than the second string.
  
  Example:
    Enter name 1: John
    Enter name 2: John
    John and John are the same.
    
    Enter name 1: John
    Enter name 2: Mary
    John and Mary.

    Enter name 1: Mary
    Enter name 2: John
    John and Mary.
